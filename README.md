# Sandwich Maker
* ###### Please Note 
    * ###### This is currently a WIP, and has not been styled as well as I would like it to be. It also has a few features such as a "clear" button, ingredient limit, individual ingredient deletion, and a tax added to the total cost. I'd also like to improve the JavaScript that runs this page as there is a more efficient way to achieve the results of this page.

## Description
   
* ## Overview  [(Link to the assignment)](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/MODULES_sandwhich.md)
    *   In this exercise I was tasked with making a page that displays 5 separate lists of different types of ingredients. There are 5 types, and 28 ingredients in total. Each ingredient Has a price displayed next to it, and a button below it that allows the user to add the ingredient to a sandwich.
    
    * When the user adds an ingredient, it is displayed in a new list below the rest which also shows the ingredient name, and price. The new list also shows a total price which is the combined cost of all ingredients that get added to the list. The list is instantly updated when the user adds an ingredient without the page needing to reload, and can accept any number of ingredients.
    

* ## What I Learned
    * I learned a lot about working modules with Webpack. This was the first assignment in which I used separate files for different features.
    * I learned how to use `import`, and `export` with my modules, and how separating a project into different files can help organize, and keep data safe.
    * I also learned a about working with the keys of objects, and using "for in" loops.
